2009-02-09: filesel/pfilesel.c: playlist now cover entire screen when selected. Pressing INSERT while in playlist now also works as expected

2009-02-08: boot/pmain.c: auto-update ocp.ini from earlier versions of ocp

2008-11-22: *: Add support for "previous" in playlist (see ALT-K for keys CTRL-J and CTRL-K). Keys make even more sense if you disable "remove from playlist" on ALT-C setup screen

2008-11-21: pfilesel/modlist.c: playing the last song on a playlist would cause strange behaviour and random crashes

2008-11-21: filesel/pfilsel.c: KEY_PPAGE/KEY_UP would cause wrap-around, now all UP/DOWN movements are boundary checked

2004-09-06: dev/devisamp.c dev/deviplay.c dev/deviwave.c: Forgot to flag to modlist that we are a file, so no device info was shown in filelist

2004-09-06: dev/sampler.c dev/player.c devs/devsnone.c: Drivers allocate their own memory, since they might do funny things like mmap()

2004-08-31: filesel/pfilesel.c: updated bugs in fsEditPath, when doing strlen() on uinitilized data, path-buffer-overrun and that enter is named _KEY_ENTER. Still behaves a bit not userfriendly until we make the filemask stuff

2004-08-31: filesel/*: removed all modlist->pathtothis stuff, and renamed dmPath to curdirpath since original ocp used that

2004-08-31: boot/kickload.c: on crash, loose setuid permissions before we kick off gdb and other cool stuff

2004-08-31: boot/plinkman.c: updated lnkDoLoad do work if LD_DEBUG is not defined (STUPID BUG), and made dll-load only available via cfProgramDir. Needed if ran as setuid.

2004-08-31: filesel/modlist.c: updated fs12name to use rindex, and removed bug using strncpy instead of strcat

* Changelog was created 31. Aug 2004. About time perhaps
