 * version 0.2.91 update missed setting the color for XM files in ocp.ini
 * Fix logic for setting screenmode vs ocp.ini. This is now the scheme and default values that SDL, SDL2 and X11 drivers use:
   [screen]
     screentype=5            ; 0=80x25, 1=80x30, 2=80x50, 3=80x60, 4=132x25, 5=132x30, 6=132x50, 7=132x60, 8=custom
     fontsize=1              ; if screentype=8: 0=8x8, 1=8x16

   unreserve the buffer-space, artificailly shrinking the available text until
   a new edit was initialized
 * Add the rReverb and iReverb plugins from the original DOS project, with some
   additional fixes
 * Show both panning/balance and chorus/reverb at the same time if they both can

 * VU right peek-meter was noisy
 * S3M files that was flooded with global commands causes buffer-overflow
 * Ctrl + C when ran in curses or linux vcsa console now does the same as

   multiple times

Version 0.2.100
===============
 * Former attempt at supporting plugins to be built-in ("static") has been
   revived and is enabled by default. By now playback-plugins and
   audio/wavetable drivers must be external still
 * Unifont is transitioning from truetype to opentype and OCP is adapting the
   change
    ./configure syntax has been changed to accomodate the changes:
    If specify by directory, the options available are
      --with-unifontdir-ttf=/path
      --with-unifontdir-otf=/path
    If specify by file (due to non-standard naming convensions and casing)
      --with-unifont-ttf=/path
      --with-unifont-csur-ttf=/path
      --with-unifont-upper-ttf=/path

      --with-unifont-csur-otf=/path
      --with-unifont-upper-otf=/path
 * Many internal functions used by playback-plugins are now being forwarded from
   core to plugins by API-tables

 * Move all file-type detection and type registration into each playback plugin,
   and autoload all playback plugins
 * In fileselector file-type-editor, selecting a blank file type (redetect
   file-type), buffer overflowed and relied on that being blank
 * Avoid crashing when opening a midi file due to missing parameter
 * 16bit WAV files were probably not able to play on big-endian systems
 * FLAC: avoid divide by zero error at end of tracks
 * Timidity/MIDI: isolate all library globals into a session and partially
   fixing channel muting
 * Internal API changes
 * ALSA: Make it possible to custom select with text input both PCM output
   device and Mixer, and bring volume mixer back to life
 * Information about selected channel disappeared from the screen when in scope,
   phase and note dots view if you visited the file browser

 * Add international keyboard support for X11
 * quickfind now supports international characters
 * cpiinst overshot memory when clearing unused space
 * Quicksearch .. and other overriden filenames in filebrowser where not working
 * Update libsidplayfp to lastest upstream master

Version 0.2.99
==============
 * Specify branch for the adplug git submodule
 * Minor error in the help text from the dumpmod utility
 * playxm (XM playback engine): A delay FX command should use the last note
   given in the channel, and not the last note that also had a delay.
 * ALSA: On buffer underruns (most common happens during SDL2 recreating
   windows and when debugging) the audio must be restarted.
 * Going from wuerfel to text mode caused OCP to freeze.
 * When running OCP in SDL/SDL2/X11 window and the user tries to close the
   window, we no longer issue a single <esc> key, but recursivly insert <exit>
   key until the program quits.
 * FreeBSD and possible others need to poll Audio Drivers as 50+ FPS, so if
   your screen FPS was set to 20, the audio would not be smooth. Added a second
   timer for this use-case.

Version 0.2.98
==============

 * MacOS updates:
   * Not able to compile on newer versions
   * Random lockups and crashes
 * Compiling psetting.c on x86 with gcc generated a lot of warnings
 * G++ 7.5.0 failed to compile one of the files
 * Remove kickstarting GDB on crash when configured with --with-debug
 * Remove usage of SIGALRM. This was only partially safe with native OSS and
   ALSA drivers
 * Update wurfel mode - search for animations in ~/.ocp aswell as the global
   data directory
 * playopl would fail to compile with clang
 * Parsing RIFF files could randomly crash (MID, WAV and MP2 files are RIFF)
 * MIDI playback could randomly assert on events-delay logic

Version 0.2.97
==============

 * Two files still references the system adplug header files instead of the
   built-in provided ones

Version 0.2.96
==============

 * ./configure now default to have --with-dir-suffix= empty. This new default
   value fits better for most packagers better. To get the previous default
   behaviour, run configure like this:
   ./configure --with-dir-suffix='-$PACKAGE_VERSION'
 * adplug and libbinio are now polled from GIT, we need access to some internal
   data not available in system installed versions.
 * adplug: music files that depend on external file resources didn't work as
   expected (e.g. Sierra game music)
 * plrGetMasterSample(): did not work as expected any more
 * cdfs: fix link-error on BSD and MacOS
 * *.AMS Extreme's Tracker files was parsed incorrectly
 * libsidplayfp: update to latest upstream version
 * 8x8 font: glyphs that are not present in OCP built-in font will now be scaled
   down from unifont 8x16
 * The fast low quality audio-mixer (devwmix) was updated
 * API between playback plugins and audio drivers has been updated

Version 0.2.95
==============

 * Add support for *.AMS Extreme's Tracker (v1.2 and v1.3)
 * Add *.RSID as a recognized filename

 * Fixed non-standard code that clang failed to compile
 * MacOS/OSX: remove `-flat_namespace` usage

Version 0.2.94
==============

     ISO9660,Juliet,RockRidge and UDF parsing. Also includes
     libdiscid/musicbrainz information lookup
   * Add support for PAK files (Westwood and Quake style)
 * Remove old i386 assembler code
 * Remove old i386 asssembler emulator code
 * SDL2: keyboard composition support (international characters etc)
 * SDL1/SDL2: Interpolate the play position
 * CDROM Audio Playback: Skipping previous tracks didn't work as expected
 * ocp.ini fps=X variable was not honored
 * Update libsidplayfp to latest upstream
 * Finish keyboard update regarding CTRL+Fx and friends
 * If libmad support is not detected, linker error occured at runtime - since we
   still referenced the meta information from the plugin
 * Some systems have different variations in the actual filenames for the
   unifont ttf files. ./configure can now be instructed about these alternative
   filenames
 * Adplug playback now support subsongs using < and > keys

Version 0.2.93
==============

 * Update the desktop icon
 * Changing font-size from the ALT+C menu didn't work as expected

   * Add a 3rd width layout for the file-display (we now have >=80,
     >=132 & >=180)
   * Escape-button when editing UTF-8 text didn't work as expected
   * Added special case for '00 being year 2000
 * If cross-compiling, ./configure needs to blindly trust that the adplug
   libraries are correct and that unifont files are present
 * Starting OCP from a directory with compressed files could crash
 * CDROM:
   * include /dev/sr[0-9] when search from cdrom-drives
   * readlink, if the link points to known devices, ignore the entry (this
     resolves issues where /dev/cdrom is removed when no CDROM-disc is present)
   * MusicBrainz:
     * Used for lookup of CDROM track metadata (can be used in future .toc/.bin
       support)
     * Add cache-browser
     * Make it possible to submit unknown discs
     * Make it possible to refresh given entries
 * Installing icons should not depend on X11 alone, but either/or X11, SDL or SDL2
 * Building without X11 support didn't work as expected

 * Add ocp.1 manpage
 * Fixes for build-system regarding install and uninstall

   are lacking on some Macs
 * OCP was unable to compile at big-endian systems
 * cphelper.c was unable to compile on some systems

Version 0.2.91
==============

 * Removed the 4x4 font, it was in most cases unreadably
 * Editing filetype for a file in the filebrowser, not displays some information per filetype
 * The current active playback plugin is now visible in the title bar
 * Mac does not have a <INSERT> key, medialib was not usable without this key. Added alternative key <RIGHT>

2015-09-07: cpiface/cpitrack.c: Do a probe of what the default/ideal zoom level is, instead of using fixed defaults. This makes more sense when we have dynamic sized windows.

2008-11-21: filesel/pfilsel.c: KEY_PPAGE/KEY_UP would cause wrap-around, now all UP/DOWN movements are boundary checked
