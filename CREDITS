First a big salute must be given to the Cubic Team for writing this player in
the first place. You guys have done a great job. Actually 90% of it. This fork
is mainly just a fork and re-embedding of all OS and assembler related stuff.

And yes.. Most stuff is rewritten to plain C instead of C++. Mostly because I
like strict C better than loose C++ that doesn't use classes for most of its
stuff.
